# Machin-Learning
In this machine learning(Data Visualization) project, I have visualized the data using python libraries and with the help of CSV Files & Python Libraries. Under the guidance of Akash sir Founder of (one_percent), I was able to do this project because I was doing it the 1st time. In this part, I analyze the large data with different forms and different types of graphs which include bar graphs, histograms, Heatmaps, surface Charts, Bubble plots, Scatter plots, line charts, Pie charts, Area Chart, Waterfall Graphs, Sunburst, Different combos, stacks. in the period on this internship project, I got lots of information about the libraries & knowledge of Data visualization.
Using python libraries like Plotly,matplotlib, seaborn, etc.,  I enjoy my work, and the support, guidance, and motivation are given by Akash sir!!!!
